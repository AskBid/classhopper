# Hirearchy of Geometries

Ascendant in complexity, descendant in purity.

```
Bezier -> BSpline -> RationalBezier -> NURBS

   Bezier         = N spans, N weights 
-> BSpline        = Y spans, N weights 
-> RationalBezier = N spans, Y weights
-> NURBS          = Y spans, Y weights
```

# TODOs
[ ] Make safe `head` and `tail` helpers. (used in Knot)
